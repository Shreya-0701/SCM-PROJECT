                <span class="contentText">The origins of Easy Bank date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the Easy Bank (EB) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, EB is synonymous with trust and security.
                <p>In line with recognized International Practice and for the information of customers and others who visit the Bank's website we believe it is necessary to post a privacy statement. The information shared with the Bank will be treated as private. We also desire to say explicitly that adequate precautions have been taken to protect information relating to customers and their dealings with the Bank from the mischievous and the fraudsters. </p>
                <p>Customer confidentiality and privacy is of utmost concern to EB. Our employees treat the information we have concerning your accounts in the same responsible and confidential way that we want our own financial affairs treated.<br>
